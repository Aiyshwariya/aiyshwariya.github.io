## Research Overview
My research interests lie at the intersection of **machine learning and environmental sustainability**, with a focus on developing data-driven approaches to assess and mitigate environmental risks.

I’m particularly interested in:
- Using **machine learning** and **statistical inference** to model environmental and infrastructure systems.  
- Applying **data science for sustainability**, including climate resilience, environmental risk assessment, and sustainable resource management.  
- Exploring how **AI and data-driven decision-making** can inform policy and large-scale sustainability initiatives.
