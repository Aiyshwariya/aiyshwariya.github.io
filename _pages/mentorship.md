# Supporting growth through mentorship and inclusion.

Mentorship has been a defining aspect of my professional journey.  
I’ve had the privilege of mentoring junior women scientists and engineers through **Women Employee Business Resource Groups (EBRGs)** at both Amazon and American Airlines.

At **American Airlines**, I mentored women transitioning from software engineering into data science, helping them navigate technical and strategic aspects of the shift.  
At **Amazon**, I guide interns and early-career scientists, focusing on professional development, networking, and goal setting.

During my time at **Purdue**, I also served as a **Graduate Teaching Assistant** for over 300 students across courses such as *Statistical Quality Control* and *Optimization for Big Data*, emphasizing the connection between theory and practice.

As a **woman of color in STEM**, I’m committed to helping others find belonging and confidence in technical spaces — building a community where **diverse perspectives drive innovation.**
