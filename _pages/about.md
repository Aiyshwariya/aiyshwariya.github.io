Hi, I'm **Aiyshwariya**, an Applied Scientist at **Amazon**, where I develop and deploy large-scale machine learning models that power forecasting and customer experience initiatives. I have a strong background in **statistical machine learning**, with experience spanning predictive modeling, NLP, recommender systems, and data-driven optimization.

Before joining Amazon, I worked as a **Senior Data Scientist at American Airlines**, where I developed AI solutions for operational efficiency and predictive maintenance. I hold a **Master’s degree in Industrial Engineering** from **Purdue University** and a **Bachelor’s degree in Technology** with a minor in **Operations Research** from the **Indian Institute of Technology Madras**.

My research interests lie at the **intersection of machine learning and environmental sustainability**,  especially in applying data-driven methods to understand and mitigate climate and resource challenges. I previously worked on assessing global sustainability metrics using unsupervised learning frameworks under the guidance of Dr. Roshi Nateghi at Purdue.

Beyond my technical work, I’m deeply committed to **mentorship and inclusion**. At Amazon and American Airlines, I’ve mentored junior women in STEM, helping them navigate career transitions and build confidence in technical roles.  

When I’m not working, you can find me playing with my dog, Sophie, reading, camping in the summers, skiing in the winters, or traveling to recharge and find inspiration.
