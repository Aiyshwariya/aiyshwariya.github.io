# Outside the world of models and data.

When I’m not working on research or applied projects, I love spending time outdoors and unwinding through simple joys. I can usually be found playing with my dog, reading a good book, or enjoying a board game with friends. I swim year-round, ski through the winter, and spend my summers hiking and camping under open skies.
