# Outside the world of models and data.

When I’m not immersed in code or research, I enjoy activities that balance analytical thinking with creativity.  
I’m an **avid swimmer**, having represented **IIT Madras** at inter-university meets — swimming remains both a grounding and meditative practice for me.

Travel and cultural exploration are other big parts of my life; I’m continually inspired by how communities across the world adapt to and coexist with their environments.
